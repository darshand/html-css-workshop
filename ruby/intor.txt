- Ruby is a developer friendly scripting language.
- Complete Object Oriented.
- Easy to learn, its just like english.

- Ruby files end with .rb extension. i,e example.rb
- To run a ruby file use 'ruby example.rb'

- No need to specify data type, ruby does it for you!
  - write numbers directly, they are considered as integers, write       number with decimal, it will recognise them as float. Write a        value within quote, they are considered as strings.
- No semicolon at the end of line!
